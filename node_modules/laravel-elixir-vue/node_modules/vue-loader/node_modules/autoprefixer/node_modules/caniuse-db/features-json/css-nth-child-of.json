  "description":"The newest versions of `:nth-child()` and `:nth-last-child()` accept an optional `of S` clause which filters the children to only those which match the selector list `S`. For example, `:nth-child(1 of .foo)` selects the first child among the children that have the `foo` class (ignoring any non-`foo` children which precede that child). Similar to `:nth-of-type`, but for arbitrary selectors instead of only type selectors.",
